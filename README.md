###### Action
I decided to implement small tasks for myself to improve my communication skills and my interviews. Firstly , I decided all the groups projects I am going to be the speaker. I am going to speak in front off all my team members to that I can build up my confidence. With my interviewing I created mock interviews for myself just so I could get comfortable with doing my interviews.
