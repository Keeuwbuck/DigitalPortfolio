I am a very shy person. I struggle to communicate with people because I am a very introvert person. So with my course that I am studing there is alot of presentations involve. Also I am going through alot of interviews lately with the companies I applied at. So doing presentations and interviews is quite difficult for me. I am currentrly trying to improve my communications skills.

I have realized that I need to be better at these skills. So I decided to set myself small goals that can influence me in the future.

###### Action
I  implement small tasks for myself to improve my communication skills and my interviews. Firstly , I decided all the group projects I am going to be the speaker. Speaking infront of my team members will boost my confidence. With my interviewing I created mock interviews for myself just so I could get comfortable with doing my interviews.
