I am a very shy person. I struggle to communicate with people because I am a very introvert person. So with my course that I am studing there is alot of presentations involved. Also I am going through alot of interviews lately with the companies I applied at. So doing presentations and interviews is quite difficult for me. I am currentrly struggling to communicate effectively.

I have realized that I need to be better at these skills. So I decided to set myself small goals that can influence me positvely in the future.

#### Action
I  implemented small tasks for myself to improve my communication skills and my interviews. Firstly , I decided all the group projects I am going to be the speaker. Speaking infront of my team members will boost my confidence. With my interviewing, I created mock interviews for myself just so I could get comfortable with doing my interviews.


#### Result
I noticed a improvement in my communication skills and my interviewing. I have confidence now to speak in front of a entire classroom.
